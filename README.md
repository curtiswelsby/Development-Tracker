# Development-Tracker
This is where I am going to document my progress through development and learning to become an expert in technology. I will be focusing on Coding and Cloud technologies.

Day 1 - 03/08/2023
I have enrolled myself in Harvards CS50 introduction to computer science. I am keen to learn computer science concepts alongside coding as i feel as though it will help with understanding the technology better.
I am also going to be trying to work through freecodecamp at the same time, starting with web development. I have a run through some of freecodecamp before and have some webdev experience but i am starting from scratch to make sure ecerything is covered.

Week 0 Scratch CS50 - The start of the video goes over computational thinking and what is computer science. Started to look at binary and ASCII, something I have done before in my computing A level but good to go over again for a refresher.

Day 2 - 04/08/2023
